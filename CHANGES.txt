Changes in current dev SNAPSHOT:

- Change which allows researcher components to be used without
  QueryComponent being present in the handler chain. ReS and Relaxer
  would not benefit from it, since they depend on original query being
  executed and its results inspected. However, ACSC will benefit. So
  far, for each query sent to ACSC (we had only grouping in it),
  original query was executed also, although it wasn't really
  needed. This change allows ACSC to live alone in handler's chain.

- Fixed situation where retried queries result in 0 hits and are not
  added to response (this is important for AC, where it makes sense to
  have 0 suggestions)

Changes in release 1.2.1:

- 2010-07-14: DYM: Fixed Levenstein distance bug that was causing
  incorrect scoring and thus poorly ordered query suggestions

2010-01-26: Release 1.1
